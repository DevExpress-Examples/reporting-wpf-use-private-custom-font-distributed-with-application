# Reporting for WPF - How to Use a Custom Font Distributed With the Application

The main idea of this approach is to use the [DXFontRepository](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Drawing.DXFontRepository) instance to store custom fonts. The report constructor creates a new font and a [XRControlStyle](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XRControlStyle) report style based on the newly created font. The new custom style is added to the [XtraReport.StyleSheet](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport.StyleSheet) collection.
